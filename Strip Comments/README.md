Complete the solution so that it Tiras all text that follows any of a set of comment markers passed in. Any whitespace at the end of the line should also be stripped out.

Example:

Given an input string of:

apples, pears # and bananas
grapes
bananas !apples

The output expected would be:

apples, pears
grapes
bananas
